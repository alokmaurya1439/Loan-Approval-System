About Dataset

This dataset is a synthetic version inspired by the original Credit Risk dataset on Kaggle and enriched with additional variables based on Financial Risk for Loan Approval data. SMOTENC was used to simulate new data points to enlarge the instances. The dataset is structured for both categorical and continuous features.

2. Metadata

3. Data Usage
The dataset can be used for multiple purposes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze key features, distribution patterns, and relationships to understand credit risk factors.

Classification: Build predictive models to classify the loan_status variable (approved/not approved) for potential applicants.
